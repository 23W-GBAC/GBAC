# General Business and Accounting

This will be an unusual introduction to business and accounting. One targeted at future developers. We will start with you, because business starts with you. Let's understand many concepts of the business world by understanding how to use your computing environment in the most optimal way for you. This means understanding operating systems, shells, and customization options. We will be reflecting on efficiency, productivity and automation. Working our way up to the market, where you need to position yourself as a developer and compete with others. Building your personal profiles and understanding collaborative systems like Git and Github is key. Building and maintaining your digital identity by sharing learning and projects will help foster your personal development.
